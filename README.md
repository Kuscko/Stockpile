<h1> Final Project : Class C# - Stockpile </h1>

<p><b>OBJECTIVE</b> create a "business level" application using forms, relational databases, and classes.</p>
<p>     My goal in making this project was to create a robust application in C# to display the skills I gained in C#.</p>
<p>     For this application you require <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/oledb/download-oledb-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15">oleDB</a> so that it can function.</p>

<p> Updated version using ASP.net and mySQL will be created later. </p>
